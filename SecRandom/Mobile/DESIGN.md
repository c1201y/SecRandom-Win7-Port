# Mobile Application Design

## Objective

Provide a usable mobile-first SecRandom workflow for roster management, fair point-call, lottery, and draw history.

## Product Context

This is an Android/iOS SingleView application built by the shared `SecRandom.App` Host. Mobile code is organized under the main app assembly and uses the same Core runtime services without starting desktop-only workflows.

## Visual Foundations

- Layout: a quiet top app bar, one scrollable content column, and a fixed bottom bar for `抽取`, `历史记录`, `概览`, and `设置`.
- The `抽取` page uses a native tab strip for `点名` and `抽奖`, a result-first surface, then the narrow-screen action panel.
- The point-call surface keeps a large result area, then a compact operation panel with list/group/gender selectors, remaining counts, a count stepper, Start, Remaining List, and More. It preserves desktop behavior without importing desktop left/right panel geometry.
- History and list management use horizontally scrollable tables: history offers profile plus overview/records modes; list rows expose common fields, a desktop-compatible attached-settings column, and a distinct More/delete operation column.
- The `设置` page is a catalog with exactly seven destinations: `通用`, `个性化`, `名单管理`, `抽取`, `备份`, `更新`, and `关于`, grouped under `偏好` / `数据` / `应用` section headers. The `更新` destination is capability-projected and hidden when in-app update is unsupported (iOS).

## Accessibility

- Navigation and draw-mode selection have visible labels, not icon-only controls. The bottom bar uses four fixed Avalonia buttons with Fluent icons, while settings rows use `FASettingsExpanderItem`; this preserves the Fluent visual language without exposing Android accessibility to FluentAvalonia's repeater peer defect.
- Primary actions are at least `48px` high and secondary actions are at least `44px` high.
- Content wraps and scrolls at phone widths; enabled state, text, and color together communicate state.
- Page content owns one vertically inertial scroll surface between the fixed app bar and bottom navigation. Dragging a navigation/settings row scrolls the page and never activates the row after movement.

## Voice & Tone

- Use concise classroom verbs such as `抽取一人`, `添加学生`, and `管理奖池`.
- Empty states direct users to the corresponding management surface instead of explaining platform internals.

## Implementation Practices

- `MobileViewHost` owns the one `NavigationPage`; it presents `MobileRootView` and independent MVE pages. `MobileRootView` owns the bottom navigation and navigates its history-disabled, uncached `FAFrame` to the regular draw/history/overview keyed `UserControl` routes.
- `settings.mobile` is a hidden mobile-only catalog generated from registered mobile groups/pages. `SettingsView` is an independent MVE page and currently reuses the desktop settings layout, starting at that catalog.
- Profile mutations save through `IProfileCatalogManager` / `IProfileService`; draws record both persistent history and temporary records. Multi-member mobile point-call orchestration stays in `MobileRollCallService` and composes the existing Core filtering, sampling, and commit services without changing the Core session contract.
- The `LotteryEnabled` Core capability remains the only decision for whether the lottery segment can be selected.
- Theme selection applies the saved `Appearance.Theme` immediately. Mobile keeps the `公平抽取` / `随机抽取` choice in roll-call settings, but when `公平抽取` is selected it runs the Core algorithm with the fixed `MobileDesktopDefaultsV1` policy snapshot and ignores persisted `MainConfigModel.FairDrawSettings` values.
- The backup section exports/imports full-data ZIP archives and settings envelopes through the system StorageProvider pickers (stream-only, SAF-safe on Android); Core `DataArchiveService` validates the SecRandom v3 manifest before any import is confirmed, and busy operations disable all actions with progress text.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not copy desktop navigation, tray controls, window controls, shortcuts, OOBE, or settings pages into mobile.
- Do not use decorative gradients, fake controls, or visible student/prize identifiers as internal identity.

## Decision-Making

- A fixed four-item bottom bar makes mobile destinations stable without duplicating desktop navigation.
- Combining point-call and lottery into `抽取` keeps the primary classroom task in one place while the capsule switcher makes the mode explicit before drawing.
- The large result panel gives the selected record classroom prominence. When enabled by the mobile draw setting, it renders per-record display images; native media playback and TTS stay behind the mobile platform seam.

## Workflow

The workflow supports tabular student/prize editing, desktop-compatible per-record image/music/voice settings, profile-aware history tables, theme selection, scoped multi-member point-call, single-prize lottery, repeat/fairness rules, remaining-list review, temporary record clearing, overview, StorageProvider-based backup/restore, and Android update checks. Spreadsheet import, proof export, notifications, and desktop integrations remain separate work.

## UI Foundation Tokens

- Mobile uses the shared application resources and the default Avalonia/Fluent control themes. It has no independent mobile style bundle or mobile-specific theme tokens.
- Page layout values are defined directly by each AXAML page or by code-behind fallback values. A page can bind a shared application resource through `DynamicResource`, but must remain usable when that resource is absent.

## Component Inventory

- `MobileCard`: lightweight content container that uses the default control appearance; an optional application-resource key can supply a result/metric background.
- `FASettingsExpander` / `FASettingsExpanderItem`: fixed settings layouts and catalog entries are declared in AXAML. Runtime code only projects capability-dependent data, storage/file flows, dialogs, tables, and media operations.
- `MobileEmptyState`: icon + title + optional description + optional guidance button that routes to the matching management surface.
- `MobileSectionHeader`: primary-tinted icon + semibold section title, replacing the `CreateLabel` IconText usage.
- `MobileSettingsPageBase`: capability projection and optional page-enter helper; SettingsView owns the mobile Back/Home controls rather than individual child pages.
- `MobileNavigationBar`: four equal native Avalonia toggle buttons hosted in the fixed bottom row, switching each Fluent icon from Regular to Filled when selected; glyphs load from `avares://SecRandom/Assets/Fonts/`. Native controls keep Android accessibility traversal and touch dispatch out of FluentAvalonia's repeater implementation.
- No generic mobile view factory remains. Stable page hierarchy belongs in AXAML; runtime construction is limited to DataGrid, dialogs, media, and StorageProvider workflows.

## Animation Primitives

`MobileAnimations` provides the mobile motion vocabulary (light Fluent-style opacity transitions, not the desktop rolling animation). Every primitive is interruptible: starting a new animation on a control cancels the previous one, and detaching from the visual tree cancels automatically. Visual animation failures are non-fatal and must not terminate the app.

```csharp
MobileAnimations.PlayPageEnter(scroll);                        // page enter: opacity fade (320 ms)
MobileAnimations.PlayResultReveal(resultText);                 // result reveal: opacity fade (250-400 ms, CircleEaseOut)
CancellationTokenSource roll = MobileAnimations.StartNameRoll(resultText, names);  // rapid candidate rolling while drawing
MobileAnimations.Cancel(resultText);                           // stop rolling/animations on a control
MobileAnimations.CrossFade(button, () => button.IsEnabled = false);  // state-change cross fade
```

- After stopping a name roll, write the final result text and then play `PlayResultReveal`.
- Animations run on the UI thread (except the name-roll timer loop) and must not block draw logic.

## Font Decision

Mobile uses the same configurable application font path as desktop. The default is the embedded MiSans
family, and the appearance settings can change both font family and weight at runtime.
