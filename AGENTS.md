## WHERE TO LOOK
| Task | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Run/build/test | `SecRandom.sln`, `.github/workflows/Build.yml` | Use solution commands; no Makefile/CMake. CodeQL builds the desktop project with `BuildInParallel=false` because the desktop asset override can otherwise schedule duplicate Core project nodes that race on Avalonia's generated resource file. |
| Desktop startup | `SecRandom.Desktop/Program.cs` | Process entry → Avalonia lifetime. |
| Platform capability contracts | `SecRandom.Platforms.Abstractions/`, `SecRandom.Platforms/` | App-internal platform root, window feature requests/results, startup context, and DI bridge. |
| Native window features | `SecRandom.Platforms.Windows/`, `SecRandom.Platforms.Linux/`, `SecRandom.Platforms.MacOs/` | Each platform owns native feature handling; views must not add platform API calls. |
| Mobile startup | `SecRandom/App.axaml.cs`, `SecRandom/Mobile/`, `SecRandom/Views/Mobile/`, `SecRandom.Android/`, `SecRandom.iOS/` | The shared `App` owns the one Host and branches by Avalonia lifetime; `SecRandom` owns the mobile root, routes, services, and platform-neutral seams while heads own entry points. |
| Mobile UI tests | `SecRandom.Mobile.Tests/` | Avalonia Headless smoke tests load mobile styles and lay out native shell controls at phone dimensions. |
| Mobile point-call orchestration | `SecRandom/Services/Mobile/MobileRollCallService.cs` | Mobile-only list/scope/count orchestration over existing Core filtering, sampling, and transactional commit services. |
| App composition / DI | `SecRandom/App.axaml.cs` | `BuildHost()` is the registration source of truth. |
| Main navigation | `SecRandom/Views/MainView.axaml.cs` | Default page `main.rollCall`; keyed DI page factory. Built-in draw pages are `main.rollCall` and `main.lottery`; quick draw opens from the floating window instead of the main sidebar. |
| Settings navigation | `SecRandom/Views/SettingsView.axaml.cs` | Default page `settings.overview`; has back stack + restart dialog. General group now includes `settings.general.basic`, `settings.general.privacy`, and `settings.general.backup`. |
| Page registration helpers | `SecRandom.Core/Extensions/Registry/` | `AddMainPage`, `AddSettingsPage`, group, and separator helpers. |
| ClassIsland notifications | `SecRandom/Services/Notification/`, `SecRandom4Ci.Interface/` | Typed v2 IPC client for the installed SecRandom4Ci ClassIsland plugin. |
| Crash recovery | `SecRandom/Services/CrashRecovery/`, `SecRandom/Views/CrashRecoveryWindow.axaml.cs` | Fatal/dispatcher crash report prompt, guarded auto-restart, and shared desktop relaunch logic. |
| Page registry state | `SecRandom.Core/Services/PagesRegistryService.cs` | Main/settings/group collections. |
| Cross-platform view engine | `SecRandom.Core/Views/` | Logical view/session contracts; desktop and mobile shells provide DI-registered physical hosts. |
| Fair draw logic | `SecRandom.Core/Services/Draw/` | Partial `DrawEngine`, weighted draw, filters, crypto RNG, plus `DrawCommitCoordinator` (`IDrawCommitService`) transactional commits and shared `DrawRepeatPolicy`/`DrawCandidateFilter`. |
| Config persistence | `SecRandom.Core/Services/Config/` | `FileConfigService` and handlers are host-internal Core runtime services; desktop keeps its existing package-root data path. v3 backup/archive transfer lives in `SecRandom.Core/Services/Archive/` (`DataArchiveService`). |
| Audit tooling | `scripts/FairnessAudit/` | Standalone fairness/performance validation script and HTML report generator. |
| Release update signing | `scripts/ReleaseManifest/`, `.github/workflows/build_publish.yml` | Ed25519 key-generation helper and CI manifest signer; private key is Actions-secret-only. Release intermediates and final artifacts are grouped under `artifacts/release/`. |
| Reusable controls/styles | `SecRandom.Core/Controls/`, `SecRandom.Core/Styles/`, `SecRandom.Core/StylesBase.axaml` | App style entrypoint includes Core bundle. |
| Localization rules | `SecRandom/Langs/`, `SecRandom.Core/Langs/`, `docs/localization.md` | Per-page resource folders; `.csproj` registers base resx/designer only. Privacy page resources live under `SecRandom/Langs/SettingsPages/General/Privacy/`. |
| Shared contracts | `SecRandom.Shared/` | Keep UI/runtime dependencies out. Profile list items use hidden stable `RecordId` keys; visible `Id`/student number/prize number is optional metadata. |
| Project rules | `docs/project_rules.md` | Strongest local convention source. |

## CODE MAP

| `Program.BuildAvaloniaApp` | entry helper | `SecRandom.Desktop/Program.cs` | Platform detect, MiSans default font, trace logging. |
| `App` | Avalonia app | `SecRandom/App.axaml.cs`, `App.Consts.cs` | Culture, XAML load, Host/DI, windows, restart/stop, theme/font refresh. |
| `IAppHost` | static service access | `SecRandom.Core/Abstraction/IAppHost.cs` | Holds Host and exposes `GetService<T>()` / `TryGetService<T>()`. |
| `MainView` | shell view | `SecRandom/Views/MainView.axaml.cs` | Main NavigationView, drawer, default page, settings window bridge. |
| `SettingsView` | shell view | `SecRandom/Views/SettingsView.axaml.cs` | Settings NavigationView, history/back, restart prompt. |
| `PagesRegistryService` | registry | `SecRandom.Core/Services/PagesRegistryService.cs` | Static collections backing generated navigation menus. |
| `DrawEngine` | domain service | `SecRandom.Core/Services/Draw/DrawEngine*.cs` | Student/prize drawing, fairness weights, repeat/avg-gap filtering. |
| `WeightedDrawEngine<T>` | algorithm | `SecRandom.Core/Services/Draw/WeightedDrawEngine.cs` | Validates weights and samples without replacement. |
| `MainConfigHandler` | config handler | `SecRandom.Core/Services/Config/MainConfigHandler.cs` | Main config wrapper over `ConfigHandlerBase<MainConfigModel>`; persists the canonical `General` subtree and still loads legacy root `basic`/`backup` JSON. |
| `ProfileService` | runtime service | `SecRandom.Core/Services/Profiles/ProfileService.cs` | Current profile runtime state, active student-list/history switching, and persistence for desktop and mobile hosts. |
| `IProfileService` | service contract | `SecRandom.Core/Abstraction/Services/IProfileService.cs` | Current lists/history + student profile switch + profile save boundary. |
| `SettingsSearchService` | app service | `SecRandom/Services/Settings/SettingsSearchService.cs` | Indexes settings pages via reflected localization resources. |
| `CrashRecoveryRuntime` | app service helper | `SecRandom/Services/CrashRecovery/CrashRecoveryRuntime.cs` | Reads crash recovery mode, writes bounded crash reports, and builds restart process plans. |
| `ISecurityService` | app service contract | `SecRandom/Services/Security/` | Owns credential verification, lockout policy, selected-factor authorization, and protected-operation gating. |
| `ProtocolCommandRouter` | app service | `SecRandom/Services/Ipc/ProtocolCommandRouter.cs` | Normalizes URL/IPC routes, routes protected commands, and returns structured IPC results. |
| `DeviceUuidStore` | app service | `SecRandom/Services/Config/DeviceUuidStore.cs` | Persists the pseudo-anonymous device UUID separately in `data/config/device-uuid.json` and migrates legacy settings values. |
| `AttachedSettingsRegistryService` | registry | `SecRandom.Core/Services/AttachedSettingsRegistryService.cs` | Static collections for attached-settings controls. |
| `ViewModelBase` | base VM | `SecRandom/ViewModels/ViewModelBase.cs` | Base VM exposing `MainConfig`; inherits `ObservableRecipient`. |
| `GlobalConstants` | constants | `SecRandom.Core/GlobalConstants.cs` | Version, platform, and development-mode constants. |
| `DrawCommitCoordinator` | domain service | `SecRandom.Core/Services/Draw/DrawCommitCoordinator.cs` | `IDrawCommitService` implementation: single `DrawRoundId`, temp→history commit order, snapshot compensation, serialized gate. |
| `DrawRepeatPolicy` / `DrawCandidateFilter` | draw rules | `SecRandom.Core/Services/Draw/` | Shared repeat-threshold and candidate-filter rules; replaces formerly duplicated copies. |
| `DataArchiveService` | domain service | `SecRandom.Core/Services/Archive/DataArchiveService.cs` | Platform-neutral v3 backup/archive engine: validation, staging commit/rollback, snapshots. |
| `IArchivePostImportHooks` | seam | `SecRandom.Core/Services/Archive/IArchivePostImportHooks.cs` | Platform follow-up after archive import; Core registers Null hooks, desktop overrides them. |
| `ProfileCatalogManager` | domain service | `SecRandom.Core/Services/Profiles/ProfileCatalogManager.cs` | List/profile CRUD and student/prize history clearing behind `IProfileCatalogManager`. |
| `RosterImportParser` | parser | `SecRandom.Core/Services/Profiles/RosterImportParser.cs` | Shared roster spreadsheet parsing and column mapping for desktop/mobile imports. |
| `IRosterQrCameraCapture` / `IRosterQrCameraCaptureFactory` | app service seam | `SecRandom/Services/RosterTransfer/IRosterQrCameraCapture.cs` | Common in-memory frame, permission, error, and lifetime boundary for list-import QR cameras. It resolves named `IPlatformCameraDeviceCatalog` devices from Host: Windows uses DirectShow/OpenCV for physical and virtual cameras, while macOS/Linux use AVFoundation/V4L2 indexes and Android maps Camera2 camera IDs to CameraView facing. |
| `IPlatformCameraDeviceCatalog` | platform contract | `SecRandom.Platforms.Abstractions/IPlatformCameraDeviceCatalog.cs` | Supplies the active platform's camera device ID, display name, capture index, and facing hint without leaking native APIs into the app layer. |
| `MobileRollCallService` | mobile service | `SecRandom/Services/Mobile/MobileRollCallService.cs` | Mobile list/scope/count snapshots, multi-member draws, remaining list, and scoped temporary reset without changing the Core session contract. |

## CONVENTIONS
- `docs/project_rules.md` overrides inference when adding features.
- General settings now live under `MainConfigModel.General`; `MainConfigModel.Basic` / `Backup` remain compatibility bridges for existing callers while new config splits belong under `SecRandom.Core/Models/SubConfigs/General/`.
- Basic settings are functional runtime controls: `ShowStartupWindow`, primary-window topmost mode, and background residency apply only to the primary `MainWindow`; `AutoSaveWindowSize` preserves independent geometry/maximized state for the primary and settings windows. Cross-platform autostart and `secrandom://` protocol registration belong to app-layer `DesktopIntegrationService`, which must use user-level Windows/Linux/macOS mechanisms and not silently persist a failed integration request.
- Selecting `TopmostMode.UiAccess` for the primary or floating window persists the setting and requests a restart. `SecRandom.Desktop/UiAccessStartup` is the Windows-only pre-Avalonia launcher boundary: following `killtimer0/uiaccess`, it elevates a bootstrap process, impersonates same-session `winlogon.exe`, sets `TokenUIAccess` on a duplicate of the bootstrap's current token, and starts the UIAccess replacement before Avalonia initializes. The original process waits only for the bootstrap to create the replacement, never for Avalonia or Host initialization; denied elevation, preparation failure, or timeout keeps the original process in ordinary topmost and preserves the configured mode for a later retry.
- Windows UIAccess topmost builds may use `SecRandom.Desktop/app.uiaccess.manifest` when `EnableUiAccess=true`; that manifest requires Authenticode signing and installation under Program Files. Independently, the runtime `UiAccessStartup` token preparation follows `killtimer0/uiaccess` and works from the ordinary manifest after UAC authorization, so debug and portable Windows builds can exercise UIAccess as well. The release workflow enables the manifest only when Windows code-signing secrets are available.
- Point-call students and lottery prizes use `RecordId` as the internal stable identity for history/fairness. The visible `Id` field is optional display metadata only and must not be required by import, draw, or history logic.
- A roll-call student or lottery prize candidate must be enabled and have a nonblank `Id` or `Name`. Import may map either column and excludes rows where both are blank.
- Picking `ClearRecord` controls temporary draw records only; do not clear persistent profile histories from that setting. RollCall and QuickDraw share the same student temporary record store, while Lottery uses prize temporary records.
- Privacy settings split Sentry upload from online status reporting: `SentryTelemetryEnabled` only controls `SecRandom/Services/Telemetry/`, while `OnlineStatusMode` only controls `SecRandom/Services/OnlineStatusService.cs`.
- Telemetry access is seam-based: runtime code depends on `ITelemetryTransaction` / `ITelemetrySdkAdapter` and must not reference Sentry types directly (the DSN lives in `GlobalConstants.SentryDsn`). `TelemetryRuntimeService` is Sentry-free; the desktop-only `TelemetryTransactionSentryExtensions` shim is excluded from mobile builds, while mobile links the same telemetry sources, adds `MobileProfilingIntegrationStub`, and owns its Sentry DI/init/shutdown plus Android/iOS unhandled-exception hooks.
- The pseudo-anonymous device UUID belongs in `data/config/device-uuid.json`; legacy settings values are migration-only and must not be serialized back into `settings.json`. Full-data and configuration backups include this file, while settings-only exports do not overwrite a device identity.
- ClassIsland notifications require the installed `SecRandom4Ci` v2 plugin. `NotificationService` uses the local `SecRandom4Ci.Interface` contract and `ClassIsland.IPC.v2.Server`; it must not use loopback TCP. SecRandom's built-in notification channel is the existing QuickDraw result window, shared by roll-call, QuickDraw, and lottery notifications. Each draw channel only controls whether it is enabled; `NotificationSettings.Default` owns the one global service, duration, threshold, fallback, and built-in auto-close configuration. `UseBuiltInOnServiceFailure` is the backend-neutral fallback policy for a selected external notification service and defaults to enabled; current ClassIsland-only delivery uses it when v2 IPC fails. For automatic QuickDraw delivery, the built-in or dual service opens this window before the draw to show the rolling animation and then its result; external-only delivery must not open the QuickDraw window unless the fallback runs. Notification settings must not duplicate the QuickDraw window's placement, opacity, or draw-animation controls.
- Crash recovery mode lives under `MainConfigModel.General.CrashRecovery`; prompt startup handling must run before single-instance acquisition, while normal restart must release the single-instance service before relaunch.
- First-run OOBE is a top-level window shown immediately after `BuildHost()` and before floating-window/main-app initialization. Its carousel begins with a non-blocking, centered welcome screen with the application icon; it is outside the seven configuration pages, whose first item places the collapsed-by-default verifiable-draw notice before the privacy-policy and GPLv3 acknowledgement controls. Each requires explicit acknowledgement. The welcome page owns the lower-left language selector; changing it persists the language, refreshes ViewModel-derived localized values, then recreates only the OOBE visual tree into localized resources without restarting or leaving the first-run flow. An active import drawer defers the visual replacement until its preview/mapping flow closes. `GuideCompleted`, `AcceptedVerificationNoticeVersion`, `AcceptedPrivacyPolicyVersion`, and `AcceptedGplVersion` determine whether an OOBE acknowledgement is required. After the full guide has completed, a verifiable-draw notice, privacy-policy, or GPL version update opens only the acknowledgement page and its privacy controls, not unrelated setup pages. OOBE class/prize spreadsheet imports reuse the list-management import controls in its own right-side drawer, so their file mapping, preview, duplicate handling, and cancel behavior stay aligned with the settings list pages. Completing OOBE continues into normal startup and explicitly opens the primary main window; it must not exit merely because the OOBE window closes. Verifiable-draw notice, privacy-policy, and GPL changes increment their app-layer OOBE versions independently.
- Settings JSON, full-data ZIP, and backup restore only accept manifest/envelope exports produced by SecRandom v3. Validate `producer_version` before taking an import snapshot or changing data; unsupported sources must be explained in a modal dialog.
- Security credentials must never be stored in `MainConfigModel` or `settings.json`. Keep passwords, TOTP seeds, USB binding tokens, and lockout state in `SecRandom/Services/Security`'s separate credential store; ordinary settings only select factors and protected operations. The sole credential file is `data/config/security/credentials.json`: its internal `FormatVersion` is authoritative, uses Argon2id-derived key material plus AES-256-GCM for portable storage, and must not depend on DPAPI, Keychain, `secret-tool`, or a versioned filename. Do not read or migrate older credential files.
- Security authorization always flows through `ISecurityService`; do not add direct validation checks to tray handlers, windows, ViewModels, or linkage code. Passwords require at least 6 characters, with no artificial character-class rule.
- Full IPC/URL compatibility is app-layer routed through `ProtocolCommandRouter`: structured current-user named-pipe IPC is additive to legacy `ShowMainWindow`/`Restart`/`Url:` delivery, and all external mutations must use `ISecurityService`. `data/*` queries must use non-mutating profile snapshots, never active-profile loading APIs.
- `HistoryItem.DrawRoundId` identifies every record committed by one logical draw. Populate it for new history writes; IPC history projections group by it and must never expose internal `RecordId`.
- Draw commits must go through `IDrawCommitService` (`DrawCommitCoordinator`): one logical draw gets exactly one `DrawRoundId` (a caller may supply one), temporary records commit before persistent history, a mid-commit failure rolls back through snapshot compensation, and commits serialize behind the coordinator gate. Never reintroduce bare two-step writes of `IProfileService.Record*History` plus temporary-record calls; the optional `drawRoundId` parameter (and `drawMethod` on `RecordPrizeHistory`) exists for coordinator use.
- File persistence saves are atomic replacements: `FileConfigService.SaveConfig` and `DrawTemporaryRecordService.SaveState` write a temporary file and atomically replace the target; new file-persistence code must follow the same pattern instead of overwriting files in place.
- Draw proofs use the SecRandom v3 algorithm ID and an `algorithmEngineVersion`. Engine v3.1 commits the sampling mode into the request: student draws use history-balanced weighted sampling, count-based lottery inventory uses equal-probability partial permutation when no internal rule applies, and pan or internal-rule lottery draws use weighted sampling without replacement. Keep the verifier's replay logic byte-compatible with each supported proof engine version.
- Ordinary draws immediately save an `OfflineReproducible` proof, then submit that newly generated proof once to `fair.sectl.cn` for background replay/signing. Startup, mode changes, and failed requests must not scan or retry historical proof files. A current server receipt signs a canonical hash of all proof fields except the receipt itself, plus the proof ID, input hash, payload hash, anonymous audit-payload hash, and mode; public sharing requires that receipt. This detects changes after the signed submission, but it does not attest to an unmodified local executable, an authentic real-world candidate pool, or absence of pre-draw result selection. Do not call it a pre-draw server witness. Local proof retention applies both the configured age and total storage limits; after every new save, delete oldest `.srproof.json` files until the configured storage cap is met.
- Formal notarization is the explicit alternative to ordinary replay attestation: the client sends a zero-seed anonymous request, `fair.sectl.cn` durably locks it, persists server random material after the lock, calculates the result, and returns an immutable `OnlineWitnessed` proof. Formal mode waits for that response and must never substitute a local draw after an error; its ledger is independent of retention-limited public proof sharing. It protects the locked flow against local code/seed/proof replacement, but cannot establish real-world roster authenticity, completeness, or pre-submission pool integrity.
- Proof ordering TODO: attestation is still enqueued when a draw completes rather than strictly after the commit boundary; deferring proof finalization/attestation until after the `IDrawCommitService` commit remains an open task. Keep this note until that ordering lands.
- Settings preview is a security-prompt outcome, not URL authorization bypass. When enabled, it freezes page content while preserving settings navigation and must not mutate configuration.
- ViewModels must be registered in `SecRandom/App.axaml.cs` `BuildHost()`; reusable services also go through Host. The mobile branch directly registers its mobile runtime services, navigation, pages, and single-view host rather than delegating to a separate application-service extension.
- The cross-platform view engine lives in `SecRandom.Core/Views/`. It separates logical Avalonia `Control` sessions, presentation intent, close/result handling, factories, and hosts. Core contracts must not expose `Window`, platform lifetimes, native APIs, or raw `IServiceProvider`; desktop and mobile shells register their physical presenters through DI.
- MVE is reserved for independent logical views with their own lifecycle, including `MainView`, `SettingsView`, crash recovery, and the modal `main.remainingList` view. Desktop shell child pages remain keyed `UserControl` instances hosted only by `FAFrame`; `desktop.main` and `desktop.settings` name the physical windows that host the two shell views, never hidden regions inside those shells. Settings read-only preview freezes the `FAFrame` content while leaving navigation available.
- Platform feature callers must resolve narrow platform contracts from Host. `PlatformStartupContext` is startup-only: desktop `Program` and Android/iOS heads set it before Avalonia starts, then shared `App` reads it once to select desktop or mobile registrations. Do not use it from views, ViewModels, Core, or business services. Removable-storage discovery follows the same boundary through `IRemovableStorageCatalog`: Windows, Linux, and macOS enumerate ready removable volumes in their matching platform projects, while the app security service consumes opaque device IDs and user-facing display locations and resolves mount paths internally. `IPlatformCameraDeviceCatalog` follows the same boundary for named QR camera choices: only platform projects may enumerate native devices; the app layer receives opaque IDs, display names, capture indexes, and facing hints. A catalog mount root is internal implementation data and must not cross into `ISecurityService` public binding APIs, UI models, dialogs, or IPC payloads. Platform discovery commands must read output asynchronously and enforce a bounded timeout before returning an empty catalog. USB binding markers use the sibling `IRemovableStorageBindingMarker` contract and always use `.SecRandom.safety.key`; binding presence requires both the platform-hidden marker token and the matching stored device record. Binding records persist only the stable device ID and token hash; mount roots are never persisted or used as identity.
- Window feature requests use `IWindowFeatureService` with a neutral `PlatformWindowHandle`, `WindowFeatureRequest`, and explicit `Applied`/`Unsupported`/`Failed` result. Keep Win32/X11/AppKit operations in the matching `SecRandom.Platforms.<OS>` project.
- Mobile `MobileViewHost` uses Avalonia `IInputPane` to keep a focused text input above the system keyboard by translating the stable page viewport, including keyboard animation timing and cleanup on host detach. Android `MainActivity` must use `SoftInput.AdjustNothing`; do not combine system resize with the host translation. Windows touch input initializes `SecRandom.Platforms.Windows.WindowsTouchKeyboardIntegration` before Avalonia startup; it opens `tabtip.exe` through the system COM bridge and uses `IInputPane` to shift an occluded focused `TextBox`. Keep both platform behaviors outside Core.
- `TopmostMode.UiAccess` remains a Windows process-token capability controlled by `SecRandom.Desktop/UiAccessStartup.cs`; it is not a generic window feature or a responsibility of platform window services.
 - Mobile front-end code is part of `SecRandom`: composition/platform contracts live in `SecRandom/Mobile/`, views in `SecRandom/Views/Mobile/`, controls in `SecRandom/Controls/Mobile/`, services in `SecRandom/Services/Mobile/`, and resources in `SecRandom/Langs/Mobile/`. `SecRandom.Android` / `SecRandom.iOS` remain the only platform entry heads. `BuildMobile=true` enables their platform TFMs (`net10.0-android` / `net10.0-ios` Exe); build the relevant head project directly for platform CI. Platform-specific code stays in the heads behind `IMobileUpdateInstaller`, `IMobileMediaPlayer`, and `MobilePlatformServiceRoot.StartupErrorLogger`. iPadOS and Android tablets set `MobilePlatformServiceRoot.UsesDesktopMainView` before Avalonia startup, so the shared app presents `MainView` and desktop main-page registrations; iPhone and Android phones retain `MobileRootView`. Shared `SecRandom.App` calls `Utils.ConfigureMobileDataRoot()` before it builds the mobile Host, registers Core/mobile services, assigns/clears `IAppHost.Host`, mounts `MobileViewHost` as `ISingleViewApplicationLifetime.MainView`, then shows the selected initial view through its `NavigationPage`. The mobile branch must not register desktop-only services, windows, tray, shortcuts, OOBE, or protocol startup paths. Android additionally exposes only `data/` through `SecRandomDocumentsProvider`; `data/config/security/` and descendants are never provider-visible. iOS has no provider and hides open-directory actions. The provider virtual root shows a single `data` child and Android path launching targets that child document via `ACTION_VIEW` (directory picker is only the fallback); all path containment and protection checks must canonicalize through `JavaFile.CanonicalPath` because app-private storage resolves through the `/data/user/0` symlink to `/data/data`, never compare raw `AbsolutePath` strings. Android settings "更多" shows the log/data/app directory entries plus their separator through `CanOpenFileManagerDirectories`; path launching maps `data/logs` and `data` to their provider documents and falls back to the provider root for non-browsable paths such as the package root.
- Mobile UI uses native Avalonia controls with FluentAvalonia settings expanders and one `NavigationPage` inside `MobileViewHost`; `MobileRootView` owns the ordinary bottom-bar `UserControl` routes while `MobileRootView` and `SettingsView` are the only mobile MVE pages. Do not add `NavigationView`, `InfoBar`, a third-party mobile component library, `MobileStyles.axaml`, or a mobile token dictionary. Stable mobile layouts are AXAML-first; code-behind is limited to runtime data projection, StorageProvider operations, DataGrid construction, dialogs, media, and service calls.
- `ViewBase` derives from `ContentPage` so the same logical view can be hosted by desktop windows or the mobile `NavigationPage`. Every independent view must set a page `Header`; it may decide its own navigation-bar and back-button visibility through `NavigationPage` attached properties.
- Mobile settings open the independent `SettingsView` MVE through `MobileViewHost`'s one `NavigationPage`, rather than becoming a normal bottom-bar route. Keep the mobile settings catalog as the navigation shell, but have it route to registered settings pages, including the desktop `UpdateSettingsPage` for `settings.update`. Do not register or restore the deprecated mobile general, personalization, list-management, draw, backup, or about settings content pages.
- Phone `MobileDrawPage` is a layout shell over the singleton desktop `RollCallPageViewModel` and `LotteryPageViewModel`. Its result area uses the same `RollCallResultPresenter` / `LotteryResultPresenter` controls as desktop, so result models, display settings, animation revisions, reset semantics, and operation text remain shared. After mobile settings closes, refresh these shared sessions through `RefreshAfterProfileChange()` rather than adding mobile file watchers or another draw ViewModel.
- `IFeatureAvailabilityService` is the sole live source for the mobile lottery tab and history tab. When lottery is disabled, hide both immediately, stop only the lottery preview, and return the draw shell to roll-call without interrupting an in-flight transactional commit.
- Resolve shared services via `IAppHost.GetService<T>()` / `TryGetService<T>()` unless constructor injection is already the local style.
- Navigation pages need `[PageInfo(...)]` plus `services.AddMainPage<T>()` or `services.AddSettingsPage<T>()` in `BuildHost()`. `AddMainPage`/`AddSettingsPage` now carry navigation metadata only; every built-in main/settings page is a Core `ViewBase` additionally registered with `AddView<T>(pageId)` so the view engine can host it.
- Built-in main navigation entries may use `PageLocation.Bottom` for bottom-pinned sidebar items; roll-call (`main.rollCall`) and lottery (`main.lottery`) are bottom-pinned and full-width/title-hidden. Quick draw is not a main navigation page and opens from the floating window.
- Page IDs: `main.xxx`, `settings.xxx`, `settings.group.xxx`.
- Picking animation style is unified: settings expose it as `AnimationStyle` / “动画样式”, and RollCall, QuickDraw, and Lottery use the same style for both rolling preview/process animation and final result reveal. Do not split process/result animation style settings.
- Managed draw music uses a platform-specific runtime boundary: desktop `settings.personalized.music` imports/deletes/previews MP3/WAV/FLAC files through `MusicLibraryService`/private SoundFlow playback, while mobile `MobileMediaLibraryService` uses StorageProvider streams into `data/audio/music` and `IMobileMediaPlayer` supplied by Android/iOS heads. Draw-settings and student/prize attached settings use the same managed IDs, no-music, or random-play options; the first drawn record supplies both overrides for a multi-record result. Deleting a managed track clears global and per-record references. Mobile display images likewise import through StorageProvider streams into `data/images`; image/music/voice failures must not invalidate a committed draw.
- Course linkage uses fixed v2 data-source values: `0=Off`, `1=CSES`, `2=ClassIsland`. CSES schedules live at `data/CSES/cses_schedule.yml`; ClassIsland is accessed only through the app-layer official IPC adapter. Only a confirmed course break restricts local draw/reset or hides the floating window. Missing/invalid CSES data, ClassIsland connection loss, or an unknown state must permit normal operation.
- CSES schedule errors follow the “`InvalidDataException` + `Data` error code” convention: `CsesScheduleException` is a static factory that throws `InvalidDataException` (sealed, so it cannot be subclassed) with a `CsesScheduleError` code and optional argument stored in `Exception.Data`; UI retrieves them through `CsesScheduleException.TryGetError` and localizes from resources.
- `LinkageSettings.VerificationRequired` governs the course-time bypass prompt and is distinct from `SecuritySettings.ProtectLinkage`, which continues to protect only external SecRandom URL/IPC mutations. Student course history uses `HistoryItem.CourseName` with `RecordId` identity; empty legacy course values remain global history.
- File/data paths should go through `Utils.GetFilePath(...)`. Desktop and portable deployments keep mutable data under the package root's `data/` directory. The shared `App` mobile branch is the controlled exception: before any path is read, it sets `Utils` once to its app-private local-data root; no Core service, view, or desktop code may redirect it later. `data/config` keeps its stable name for compatibility but is hidden at the filesystem level where supported (Windows `Hidden|System`; Unix-like hosts use the parent `.hidden` convention as a fallback), and hiding failures must not block config I/O.
- Desktop startup calls `Utils.PrepareDesktopDataRoot()` before reading settings. Installed packages use `<PackageRoot>/data` when it passes a real write probe and otherwise use `LocalApplicationData/SecRandom/data`; portable ZIP packages never fall back to a per-user directory, and a failed write probe blocks startup with the transient `SecRandomTmpRootWindow`/`FATaskDialog` warning host.
- Desktop builds copy `SecRandom/Assets` beside the executable and bind `OverlayAssetLoader` so existing `avares://SecRandom/Assets/...` URIs load physical files first, including Debug builds. Android and iOS keep the same assets embedded. `Assets/Updates/release-public-key.txt` is embedded on every target and must never be resolved from the physical overlay.
- Portable ZIP updates use `SecRandom.Launcher` at the stable package root and activated `app-*` payload directories. The application, not Launcher, validates/downloads/extracts/activates a complete ZIP; `Utils.PackageRoot` / `DataRoot` keep user data stable across payload versions.
- Update discovery uses a fixed GitHub mirror first, with GitHub direct access as fallback. A detached Ed25519-signed release manifest and each artifact's length/SHA-512 must verify before deployment or a system installer is started; signing keys remain outside the repository. Desktop artifacts, the signed Android arm64 APK, and the unsigned iOS arm64 IPA share this manifest. Android downloads its verified APK then delegates installation to the system package installer; iOS device distribution and in-app update delivery remain deferred.
- Localization is per page folder: `Resources.resx`, `Resources.Designer.cs`, `Resources.en-US.resx`, and `Resources.ja-JP.resx`; every new or changed user-facing string must be supplied in Simplified Chinese, English, and Japanese, preserving exact filename casing used on disk.
- In `.csproj`, register only `Resources.resx` and `Resources.Designer.cs`; do not register every language variant.
- Resource designer generator must be `PublicResXFileCodeGenerator`.
- Localization keys: `S_` settings, `S_xxx_D` description, `S_xxx_R` real key, `O_` options, `M_` messages, `C_` controls.
- Chinese i18n values must not use the Chinese full stop (`。`).
- Settings-page explanation values (`*_D`, including `S_*_D` and `C_*_D`) must not use sentence-ending or sentence-separating full stops (`。` or `.`); preserve technical dots in file names, domains, process names, and version identifiers.
- Views commonly set `DataContext = this` and expose `ViewModel`; bindings use `ViewModel.*`.
- ViewModels use CommunityToolkit MVVM (`ObservableRecipient`, `[ObservableProperty]`); app VMs inherit `SecRandom.ViewModels.ViewModelBase`.
- `Global.props` carries the main MSBuild behavior: unsafe enabled, Windows targeting enabled, SourceLink, full debug symbols, and default exclusion of project-local `artifacts/` / `publish/` output trees from SDK item globbing. The Git-info analyzer remains available to all projects, while the shared `AssemblyInfo.cs` is enabled only by projects that explicitly set `EnableGitInfoGenerator`; current versioned assemblies are `SecRandom.Core`, `SecRandom.Desktop`, `SecRandom.Android`, and `SecRandom.iOS`.
- `Directory.Build.props` only pins `AvaloniaVersion`.
- Standalone verification scripts live under `scripts/`; keep them self-contained and write outputs under `artifacts/`.
- Release CI keeps generated material under `artifacts/release/`: RID publish trees under `publish/`, portable ZIP assembly under `portable/`, Windows installer staging under `installer/` and `setup/`, platform package workspaces under `linux/` / `macos/`, upload candidates under `dist/`, and release-job downloads/final signed assets under `downloaded/` / `output/`. Every Android build must receive the same configured release keystore secrets, rejects missing signing configuration, and verifies the produced APK certificate against that keystore before upload. The Android job stages signed arm64 and x64 APKs separately; the release job includes the supported APK artifacts in `output/`, the signed manifest, and the GitHub release. Portable ZIP contents must remain a root `SecRandomLauncher` plus one valid `app-*` payload directory; do not rearrange that runtime package contract.
- More settings owns built-in draw page chrome options such as roll-call/lottery control panel position and control visibility; do not hard-code those controls outside the page/config binding.
- `MoreSettings.LotteryEnabled` is the single capability switch for lottery. It must consistently gate main navigation, floating-window buttons, shortcuts, and URL/IPC routes.
- Application-owned Fluent System Icons use the `Filled` variant by default across navigation, settings, buttons, menus, floating windows, and empty states. Use the closest semantic `Filled` icon when no same-name variant exists.
- New application icon references must use `FluentIcon`, `FluentIconSource`, `sr:Fi`, or `FluentIcons.*`; do not add raw Fluent Unicode glyphs. When migrating a raw glyph, reverse-map its code point through `SecRandom.Core/Assets/FluentSystemIcons-Resizable.json` before choosing the Filled replacement.
- Brand images, author/organization images, window icons, and taskbar icons are separate resources and are not part of Fluent glyph style migration. FluentAvalonia template glyphs remain framework-owned unless an application-owned style explicitly overrides them.

## COMMENT STYLE
- Keep comments that explain non-obvious project constraints, platform quirks, or AI-prone rules.
- Do not add comments that merely restate a method name or obvious assignment.
- Existing emphatic comments in `BuildHost()` about ViewModel registration reflect a real project invariant; preserve the rule even if wording is later cleaned up.

## MAINTENANCE CHECKLIST
AI agents must update AGENTS files when they:
- Add, remove, or rename top-level folders or projects.
- Change `TargetFramework`, package family, `AvaloniaVersion`, CI SDK versions, or publish RIDs.
- Change Host/DI registration, navigation page registration, page IDs, or default pages.
- Change localization folder layout, resource designer registration, or culture filename casing.
- Move draw/config/profile services or alter Core/Shared namespace boundaries.
- Discover a durable convention while fixing code that is not yet documented here.
- Remove stale facts encountered during work instead of leaving them for a later cleanup.

## ANTI-PATTERNS (THIS PROJECT)
- Do not add ViewModels without Host registration in `BuildHost()`.
- Do not hardwire navigation menu items; register pages/groups and let registry/services build menus.
- Do not `new` reusable services from pages; put reusable/singleton/testable services in Host.
- Do not merge page localization into a shared resource bucket.
- Do not assume dictionary mutations auto-save config; call save after collection mutations or on unload.
- Do not use `Student.Id` / `Prize.Id` as a required identity key; use `ProfileRecordIdentity` / `RecordId` and keep legacy `Id`/`Name` history fallback ambiguity-safe.
- Do not treat `SecRandom.Desktop` as the app logic layer; it is only the launcher.
- Do not edit `bin/`, `obj/`, `artifacts/`, `publish/`, packaging scratch dirs, or generated build output.
- Do not encode temporary local environment facts in AGENTS files; prefer durable rules that future AI agents can maintain.

## UNIQUE STYLES
- Avalonia compiled bindings are enabled in `SecRandom/SecRandom.csproj`.
- `SecRandom/Styles.axaml` is only the app style entrypoint; shared styles live under `SecRandom.Core/StylesBase.axaml` and `SecRandom.Core/Styles/`.
- Shared UI controls are in Core, not only app: `DrawerHost`, `Field`, `IconText`, `AppToastAdorner`, `AttachedSettingsControlPresenter`, `FluentIcon`, `FluentIconSource`, `StickyScrollViewer`, `TouchDragThumb`, `Empty`, `Emptiable`, `DevelopmentBuildAdorner`.
- UI uses FluentAvalonia `NavigationView`, `SettingsExpander`, `FluentIconSource`, and custom selector classes (`compact`, `nav-back`, `drawer-left/right`, `FullWidth`).
- Default font is MiSans from Avalonia resource URI `avares://SecRandom/Assets/Fonts/MiSans/#MiSans`.
- README/docs are Chinese-first with English/ZH-TW mirrors under `resources/`.

## NOTES
- Build workflow and CodeQL use .NET SDK `10.0.x`. The iOS job on `macos-26` pins Xcode `26.6` through `maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode@v1`; do not override that selection with `DEVELOPER_DIR`, and retain its `xcode-select` / `xcrun --find strip` checks to catch mixed toolchains.
- In PowerShell release-workflow regex strings, delimit a variable immediately followed by a colon as `${variable}:`; `$variable:` is parsed as a scoped-variable reference and makes the whole script fail to parse.
- The desktop `Publish Desktop` and UIAccess publish steps must run `dotnet publish` with `-p:BuildInParallel=false -p:UseSharedCompilation=false` and must check `$LASTEXITCODE` after every publish. The two full/light publishes share the same `obj/` tree, so parallel builds and the shared `VBCSCompiler` race intermittently with `CS2012` file-lock failures on Windows; a masked (unchecked) failure leaves `publish/full` incomplete and breaks downstream portable/installer packaging with confusing "file does not exist" errors. Keep the `Verify bundled audio runtime` step enabled so an incomplete self-contained publish is caught at its source instead of silently producing broken artifacts.
- The mobile `Build Android APK` and `Publish unsigned iOS arm64 IPA` steps must also pass `-p:BuildInParallel=false -p:UseSharedCompilation=false` (and the iOS step runs with `set -euo pipefail`). The shared `SecRandom.Core`/app graph is otherwise scheduled twice in parallel within a single build, racing on `obj/Release/net10.0` resource outputs with `MSB3554`/`CS1566`/`MSB4018` "being used by another process" failures on any platform.
- Android release signing decodes `ANDROID_SIGNING_KEYSTORE_BASE64` by trimming whitespace and translating URL-safe base64 (`-`→`+`, `_`→`/`) before `Convert.FromBase64String`, then validates the bytes with `keytool -list` before invoking `dotnet build`. Do not strip non-base64 characters blindly: a junk character (beyond whitespace/URL-safe chars) means the secret value itself is malformed, and deleting it silently corrupts the keystore so apksigner later fails with the opaque `MSB6006: "java" exited with code 2`. A decode failure must report the offending character's code point and require re-provisioning the secret, never a lossy strip. `keytool -J-*` options must be passed through array splatting (`& keytool @args`) — as bare `-J-Duser.language=en` tokens PowerShell splits them into `-J-Duser` + `.language=en`.
- Release workflow triggers on tags `v*`, manual dispatch, PR/push build, or commit message containing `开始构建`.
- Test project currently includes `UnitTest1.cs` coverage for legacy privacy/telemetry migration behavior.
- `vendors/EdgeTtsSharp/` is the Edge TTS synthesis submodule. Its embedded voice list and synthesis source are compiled by the app; `Services/Voice/EdgeTtsSharpCompatibility.cs` supplies the cross-platform transport seam, and all playback remains in ClassIsland's `SoundFlow` MiniAudio package from the repository-wide MyGet source.
- README mentions `vendors/pythonnet-stub-generator/`; treat it as third-party if present in future snapshots.
- CodeQL workflow (`codeQL.yml`) runs on push, PR, and weekly schedule; C# scans use manual build mode with .NET SDK `10.0.x`.
- Keep `SecRandom.Core` public contracts stable.
